# Phase 1 week 2 Code challange (Shopping list)

## By Namada Junior

## Project Description


The website is a simple shopping list website that allows users to add items to a list and check them off when they have been purchased. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and uses a simple button to add items to the list and a clear button to remove all items from the list. The website also uses some custom fonts and colors to make it visually appealing.
